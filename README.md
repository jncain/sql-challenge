# sql-challenge
This is a repo that contains my solution to Homework 9 (sql-challenge) for Data Visualization Cohort 6.


Notes about this assignment:
- I created an additional table for titles for normalization. The table (position_title) includes a title_id and title.
- Then I updated the titles table so that the column for titles now contains the title_id, identified in the position_title table.
